# Getting Started with this project

## 0. Download project from git repo, zip or git clone

## 1. Install all packages with * npm install *

## 2. Run the command * npm run dev *
### This will run two servers concurrently, one which is the application frontend and other for API requests or backend which we use to edit and update vehicles in JSON directly

## 3. In the LOGIN FORM you can write which ever email and password you want, as long as the Name field is Fleet Owner
## Fleet Owner 

## 4. When you are logged in, you have the possibility to LOG OUT, the button is to the far right top

## 5. You can see the entire fleet with information about each vehicle clearly displayed

## 6. You have the functionality of both Editing and Deleting the vehicles
### OBSERVE ! Deleting and Editing are directly connected to JSON file, so every change you make to the vehicle is saved in the JSON file as well. 

## 7. On EDIT you are welcomed by the information about the vehicle and driver that you can change, as well as info about equipment related to that vehicle that you can add/remove !
### OBSERVE ! If changing the DRIVER NAME the image will dissapear because it is directly connected to its name by source(url)

### Small bug can be noticed on adding and removing equipment (needs to be clicked twice sometimes) --> Will try to resolve by next meeting

## 8. Status of the vehicle is displayed in the far right bottom corner of the card, and it is also editable through the EDIT form. 

## If some step is missing or you have some questions that need to be answered, just write to me... Have fun trying out the APP.
